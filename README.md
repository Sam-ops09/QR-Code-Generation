# QR Code Generation

This repository contains a Python script for generating QR codes using the `qrcode` module. QR codes are two-dimensional barcodes that can be scanned by mobile devices to quickly and easily access information or websites.

## Prerequisites

To run the script, you will need to have Python 3.x installed on your computer. You will also need to install the `qrcode` module using pip. You can do this by running the following command:

```
pip install qrcode[pil]
```

This will install both the `qrcode` module and the `pillow` module, which is needed for image processing.

## Usage

To use the script, simply run it using Python from the command line:

```
python generate_qr_code.py
```

The script will then prompt you to enter the data you want to encode in the QR code. Once you enter the data, the script will generate a PNG image of the QR code in the same directory as the script.
